# Introduction to gen AI

## What is Generative AI?

**Generative AI** refers to a subset of artificial intelligence technologies capable of generating new content, ideas, or data that resemble or mimic human-like outputs.

## Who develops generative AI tools

- Generative AI technologies are often developed by publicly traded companies with:
    - Deep pockets
    - Shareholders
    - Motives and goals that may diverge from academic or public interests

- These technologies also require significant computing resources for training and operation
  - This skews access and development to those with substantial resources.
  - If you feel sad or overwhelmed by the low sense of control, read [Choose Your Weapon:
Survival Strategies for Depressed AI Academics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10458714)

1. Human intelligence is not unidimensional: 

  - Cognitive abilities: memory, logic, problem solving, etc.
  - Emotional intelligence: such as empathy and self-awareness

## How do humans learn?

There are multiple forms of learning:

1. Experiential learning: Learning through direct experience with an emphasis on reflection and application
2. Social learning: Learning through observation and interaction with others with an emphasis on social context and collaboration
3. Symbolic learning: Using language and numbers to convey information

## Neuroplasticity is key
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural pathways throughout life.

## The 10,000 hours *rule*

Roughly 10,000 hours of deliberate, focused practice are needed to achieve mastery in a complex skill

This idea was populatized by Malcolm Gladwell in his book *Outliers*.

It has a scientific basis in the work of Ericson, Krampe and Tesch-Romer (1993)

Later research by [Macnamara, Hambrick, and Oswald (2014)](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1177/0956797614535810) examined the role of deliberate practice across various domains. It turns out that while practice plays an important role, it is not the sole determinant of success.

## Promise so far

AI is said to contribute to learning and mastering skills in at least the following ways:

- Personalized feedback and adaptation
- Leveling the playing field: scalability and accessibility
- Performance measures and insights into one's progress
- Simulated environments, tests, and practice scenarios

## Promise so far {auto-animate=true}

AI is said to contribute to learning and mastering skills in at least the following ways:

- Personalized feedback and adaptation
- Leveling the playing field: scalability and accessibility
- Performance measures and insights into one's progress
- Simulated environments, tests, and practice scenarios

But, also:

- Potential overrelience on technology and AI tools
- Wrong learning paths and cognitive shortcuts 
- Poor or incorrect feedback due to faulty models (until GSI)
- No nuanced insights and human-equivalent mentorship (yet)
- No human, which would require at least a hybrid interaction
- Self-assessment and critical thinking skills are at stake

## Self assessment impact

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple"}
Self-assessment covers the ability to critically reflect on your own work and progress
:::

If learners depend too heavily on AI to evaluate and correct their work, they might not fully develop their own ability to judge the quality of their efforts:

- Over-relience on feedback lowers the development of your own reflective and evaluative processes. 
- Reliance on external validation creates pathways to look to AI tools to determine what is good/bad, right/wrong.
- If you grow accustomed to using AI tools, you are not (further) developing metacognition skills: the ability to think about and control your own learning process.
- Risk of passive acceptance of AI content and feedback

## To sum it up

![](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c7/98/be/c798be4274ad6cae441262d1f582d225.jpg)
## The key steps in learning

1. Getting students to pay attention
2. Giving information
3. Making them understand
4. Practice makes perfect
5. Reflection and feedback
6. Combination and knowledge transfer

## Getting students to pay attention

Engaging students and capturing their attention is the first step. Without attention, there is little opportunity for deeper learning. 

**How AI can help**

- Gamification and adaptive content can help students to engage, although gamification is known to have mixed results and not contribute to deeper learning on average. 
- AI generated visual content may spark attention -> *but costs carbon and hurts creators*
- The ubiquitous private tutor

**How AI can hurt**

- Too much information and sensory overload will fragment attention
- Entertainment-style interactions can hurt focused learning

**Our role**
We need to create a learning environment that is already sufficiently engaging and stimulating, but not overwhelming.

## Giving students information

We present students with information. Sometimes this body of information is very large. 

**How AI can help**

- AI can assist students to process large amounts of information very quickly
- Summaries and visualizations can help to make complex topics more digestible

**How AI can hurt**

- Relying on AI to synthesize information may lead to surface-level understanding and make the learning outcome too superficial
- Nuance and broader integration of information into existing knowledge may already be lost here
- AI might create a filter bubble, where only certain sources are prioritized and diverse perspectives are limited

**Our role**
Communicate clearly to students what is required of them in terms of understanding and processing information and meta-cognition skills. If AI syntheses could be useful, it is better to provide carefully curated syntheses to students to avoid the filter bubble. 

## Making them understand
Students need to process the information, form connections and integrate the newly learned information into their existing knowledge.

**How AI can help**

- The ubiquitous private tutor
- Reframing and explaining difficult concepts in ways that are more in line with the cognitive abilities and interests of students
- Ask for potential relations of new information to previously learned concepts

**How AI can hurt**
- If your *tutor* dumbs it down too much, you might not get the full picture
- If you ask for relations, AI will find them, even if they are not there. 
- Reduced deeper engagement with the material
- Immediate *answers* may hinder the development of self-assessment, synthesis and analysis skills

**Our role**
Make students discuss and debate the material in a non-AI environment. Test the deeper integration of knowledge explicitly in your assessments. Educate students in prompt engineering.

## What can we learn from this?

GenAI tools can be a great asset in the educational process. They can help students to be more productive, to code more effectively and to develop new skills.

This does not mean that they learn more or better. It means that they can be more effective in their learning process.

The bottomline is that this learning process needs to be established before you can use add AI to it. 

If GenAI is replacing the thinking process, humanity may stumble into an existential crisis.

## Conclusion
The way that humans learn has not changed. The tools that we have at our disposal, however, are becoming more plentiful.  We should be careful in implementing these tools into student learning, as they may pose a threat to our cognitive relevance. 

Teaching students how to leverage their own work and creativity is a prime goal for the future of education. 

Teaching our community to replace their own thinking with AI tools will limit the potential of our scientific effort and our intellectual property.

::: {.callout-tip}
Use generative AI tools to extend your capabilities, not to replace them. AI is IMO not part of the human evolution process.

## Towards responsible genAI use
I believe that we should demand from the scientific community to follow these simple steps when using generative AI tools:

1. Minimize the use of AI tools, as they are (currently) environmentally unfriendly
2. Don't input confidential or personal information
3. Don't input information that violates IP or copyright
4. Don't violate IP with using output from the tool
5. Confirm the output accuracy
6. Check the tool output for bias
7. Disclose the use of AI tools in your work
8. Don't do naughty or unjust things with AI tools
9. Ask the tool not to use input for training
10. Open the content you produce by using AI tools as much as possible with permissive licenses

If in doubt about any of the above, don't use generative AI tools.

For teachers: Put a disclaimer on your materials that governs what is or is not allowed when using generative AI tools.

## Student rights in the AI-Era Classroom

::: {.callout-tip}
## Human contact is a right
Every student has the right to be educated and graded by a human being. That right also includes the right to know a priori to what extend AI is used 

1. in creating the educational materials, 
2. in providing feedback,
3. in grading student work.

Every student has the right to refuse interaction or any other involvement with an AI for their coursework.
